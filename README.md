### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of Plato's Pizza for the year 2015. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance. 


### Data Sources

### Tools Used
Excel

- Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Created a new sheet to duplicate the original data for the cleaning.
- Inspected the data for any missing values by using the column header row of each columns.
- Data cleaning and formatting by ensuring the data is consisitent and clean with respect to data types, data format and valued used.
- Added new columns to extract the month and days from the Order date to answer some of the questions for the analysis. The Text function was used for this extraction; =TEXT([@[order_date]],"mmmm") and =TEXT([@[order_date]], "dddd").

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

- To reduce operational cost, Plato's pizza should consider operating from 12pm to 11pm.
- Plato's Pizza should consider running promotions in the month of september and october to boost sales during that period.
